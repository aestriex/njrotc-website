Source code for the SKHS NJROTC Website. I originally coded this on Glitch and hosted it with  one of thier domains, however, I have transferred it to being hosted on a custom domain via [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). This repository documents the code used on said website.

Any support/bug checks/etc. are appreciated.
